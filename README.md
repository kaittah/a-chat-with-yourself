## a-chat-with-yourself

Have you ever wanted to talk to your past self? If you use Facebook Messenger to chat and have a good amount of chat history, follow the instructions below!

To run:

1. Update src/globals.py to contain a valid OpenAI API key
2. `pipenv install`
3. Save downloaded Facebook JSON data as a .zip file in src/store/input
4. run main.py in the virtual environment

How to download Facebook history: https://www.zapptales.com/en/download-facebook-messenger-chat-history-how-to/
**Be sure to select JSON as message format instead of HTML and download full message history**

Be very careful with the data you download from Facebook. Do not share it or upload it to any website because it is personal data. Keep this stored locally and remove sensitive information when making a connection to an API.
